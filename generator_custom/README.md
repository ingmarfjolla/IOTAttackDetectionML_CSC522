# CTGAN Directory

This directory contains files for the CTGAN generator. The generator_ctgan.ipynb contains 
code for generating a ctgan, saving it, and loading it. The different python files each 
create a different subset of the dataset. 

We currently have a small, and medium synthesizer trained and ready to deploy and create data.
